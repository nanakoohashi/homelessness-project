# Homelessness Project

## Summary
This dataset reports the national estimates of homelessness by state from 2007 - 2018. Estimates of homeless veterans are included from the beginning of 2011. This dataset was obtained from [**HUD EXCHANGE**](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3031/pit-and-hic-data-since-2007/).

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
Windows 10

### Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- zipfile

## Steps
### 1. Gather data
I started this project by importing essential packages and reading the .csv file. 

### 2. Assess the data 
Using common data assessing code, I assessed the data and looked for any issues with the type of data and format of the data in the two datasets. 

### 3. Clean the data
I fixed the issues I found while assessing the data, merged the two data sets, and prepared the new data set for visualization.

### 4. Visualize
I used Tableau to visualize the data from the cleaned data sets.
